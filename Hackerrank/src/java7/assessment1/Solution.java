 * Given two arrays of positive integers, for each element in the second array, find the total number of elements in the first array which are less than
 * or equal to that element.  Store the values determined in an array.
 * 
 * For example, if the first array is [1, 2, 3] and the second array is [2, 4], then there are 2 elements in the first array less than or equal to 2.
 * There are 3 elements in the first array which are less than or equal to 4. We can store these answers in an array, answer = [2,3]
